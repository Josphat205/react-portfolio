      'Josphat is exactly the sort of software developer any company would love. I met as a friend on microverse, and we had an activity to work on together. I was struggling with the data structure and algorithm, but he within a few minutes was able to solve the problem and explain it in the most understandable way. He has a great way of simplifying complex problems into bite-sized pieces, he is also a fun person to chat with! Indeed a very good team player he is.Josphat is exactly the sort of software developer any company would love.',

      "Josphat is one of the brightest software developers I've ever met. I worked alongside him from the very beginning of my web development journey. In that time he proved his commitment and determination over and over again. Josphat is always challenging Himself--He's the type of person who solves algorithm challenges for fun, and His attention to detail is evident in all of the projects I've worked with him on. He's also genuinely a kind, encouraging person, and kept me from falling into bug blues multiple times. I can recommend Him without reservation.",
